T-Mobile's servers were hacked into in August 2021 and personal information was stolen
for approximately 100 million T-Mobile customers. The stolen data included IMSI (International Mobile
Subscriber Identity), IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity), phone number, customer name, security
PIN, SSN, driver license number, and date-of-birth.

The hackers were able to obtain SSH access to production servers and obtain access to the Oracle database.

"The breach was done to retaliate against the US for the kidnapping and torture of John Erin Binns (CIA
Raven-1) in Germany by CIA and Turkish intelligence agents in 2019," the hacker allegedly told Alon Gal,
the co-founder of cybercrime intelligence firm Hudson Rock.

The hackers did not try to ransom the data to T-Mobile because they had ready buyers for the stolen data.

"We are aware of claims made in an underground forum and have been actively investigating their validity.
We do not have any additional information to share at this time," T-Mobile told BleepingComputer.

It is unclear what changes T-Mobile has made to address the issue.
